## Phase 2: Event-Driven Architecture and Advanced Features (3-6 Months)

### Objectives
- Integrate event-driven communication to decouple services and enhance real-time interactions.
- Add Medication and Notification services to support patient treatments and communication.
- Implement advanced caching and search features to improve user experience and system performance.

### Detailed Deliverables

1. **Enhanced Appointment Scheduling Service with Event-Driven Architecture**
    - **Event-Driven Updates**: Use **Kafka** to broadcast events related to appointments for real-time updates.
    - **Saga Pattern**: Implement Saga Pattern for distributed transaction management during appointment booking.
        - **Implementation**: Use a choreography-based approach with Kafka, where each service listens and publishes events to confirm or roll back transactions.

2. **Medication Service**
    - **Purpose**: Manage prescriptions, dosages, and medication schedules.
    - **Database**: Use **MongoDB** for flexible and hierarchical data structures suited to medication details.
    - **Caching**: Integrate **Redis** for caching frequently accessed medication data to optimize response times and reduce MongoDB load.

3. **Notification Service**
    - **Purpose**: Send appointment, medication, and system notifications.
    - **Messaging Queue**: Integrate **RabbitMQ** for reliable delivery of notifications to ensure message delivery even with temporary service outages.
    - **Notification Channels**: Plan for email, SMS, and push notifications with customizable templates.

4. **Search Service**
    - **Purpose**: Enable full-text search across patient records, appointments, and medications.
    - **Database**: Use **Elasticsearch** to support scalable, fast, and flexible search capabilities.
    - **CQRS Pattern**: Separate query models for search and command models for data changes, with Kafka used for data synchronization.

5. **Advanced gRPC Usage**
    - Define additional gRPC service contracts between core services where low latency is critical (e.g., fetching patient details in real-time during appointment scheduling).
    - Implement data serialization with **Protobuf** to reduce message payloads and improve network efficiency.

## Phase 3: Security, Resilience, and Enhanced User Experience (6-9 Months)

### Objectives
- Secure all APIs with robust authentication and authorization mechanisms.
- Enhance service resilience and manage failure gracefully.
- Optimize the search and scheduling functionalities for improved performance.

### Detailed Deliverables

1. **Security Implementation**
    - **Spring Security**: Implement **OAuth2** and **JWT**-based authentication to ensure secure and scalable API access.
    - **Data Encryption**: Use data encryption and hashing techniques to protect sensitive information, such as health records.
    - **Audit Logs**: Implement logging of sensitive actions for compliance with data security standards (e.g., HIPAA).

2. **Resilience and Circuit Breaking**
    - **Circuit Breakers**: Integrate **Hystrix / Resilience4j** to manage service failures and prevent cascading issues across the system.
    - **Fallback Mechanisms**: Design fallback methods to maintain essential functionalities during service outages.
    - **Timeout Management**: Set timeouts and retry strategies for critical service calls, using Resilience4jâ€™s capabilities.

3. **Enhanced Search and Caching Strategies**
    - Improve **Search Service** response time by indexing high-priority data in Elasticsearch.
    - Enhance **Redis** caching strategies for high-demand queries, especially those related to real-time data in the Medication and Patient services.
